Welcome to Auto-Mate! We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at [Your Contact Email].

When you visit our application, Auto-Mate (the "App"), and use our services, you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy policy, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our App and our services.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our App, and/or any related services, sales, marketing, or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the "Services").

## 1. What Information Do We Collect?

### 1.1 Personal Information You Disclose to Us

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering at the App, expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when participating in activities on the App, or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Passwords
- Social media accounts (via OAuth authentication)
- Any other personal information you choose to provide

### 1.2 Information Automatically Collected

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the App. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

## 2. How Do We Use Your Information?

We use the information we collect or receive:

- To facilitate account creation and logon process.
- To send administrative information to you.
- For our business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns, and to evaluate and improve our App, products, services, marketing, and your experience.

## 3. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?

We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations. We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:

- Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
- Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.
- Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.

- Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

## 4. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

## 5. Do We Collect Information From Minors?

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

## 6. What Are Your Privacy Rights?

In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
